# Sentence Type and Structure Classification Models


## Overview
This repository contains models and code for classifying sentence types and identifying sentence structures. The project focuses on two main tasks:

- Sentence Type Classification: Identifying the type of sentence (e.g., declarative, interrogative, imperative, exclamatory).
- Sentence Structure Classification: Extracting and classifying clauses within sentences as independent or dependent.

## Features
- Sentence Type Classification: A model trained to classify sentences into various types based on their content and structure.
- Sentence Structure Classification: A model that identifies and classifies clauses within sentences, providing indices and types for each clause.
